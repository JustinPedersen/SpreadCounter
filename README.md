# SpreadCounter
A faster way to count petri dish spreads! 

# What is this? 
This project originally started as a cool excuse to mess around with OpenCV computer vision in an attempt to aid in
counting spots on a petri dish for my better half's lab work. 

Counting colonies on a dish can, in the best of times be a tedious task when you have a few hundred to get through.
However, counting circular objects in an image can be a trivial task for computers. This application aims to speed up
the process of counting spots as well as provide that data back in an easily manipulated and presentable format such
as excel spreadsheets and marked images.
